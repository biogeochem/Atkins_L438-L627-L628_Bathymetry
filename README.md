# Atkins_L438-L627-L628_Bathymetry


## Summary

Bathymetric and hypsographic data and maps for IISD-ELA Lakes L438, L627, and L628. Field data were collected with a Humminbird HELIX 5 CHIRP GPS G2 Shapefiles and bathymetric maps were generated in ReefMaster 2. These lakes did not previously have bathymetric and hypsographic data available for them. These lakes are part of a lake-size survey and the L626 Diversion project.
